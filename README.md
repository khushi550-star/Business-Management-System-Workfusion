Business-Management-System-Workfusion-
Project with both Frontend and Backend (HTML,CSS, Js, with backend PHP using MySql) 
WORKFUSION is a centralized web-based Business Management System that automates employee management, attendance, payroll, leave tracking, meetings, tasks, and announcements.
Instead of relying on separate tools or manual registers for each process, this platform brings all essential business activities under a single interactive interface.
Administrators can manage records, while employees can mark attendance, apply for leaves, view payroll, access tasks, and stay updated, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and smooth communication.
